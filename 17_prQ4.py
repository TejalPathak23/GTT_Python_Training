# Python Program to find simple intrest

# Simple interest formula is given by:
# Simple Interest = (P x T x R)/100
# Where,
# P is the principle amount
# T is the time and
# R is the rate
p = int(input("Enter the value of the principal : "))
t = int(input("Enter the value of the time : "))
r = int(input("Enter the value of the rate of intrest  : "))
print('The principal is', p)
print('The time period is', t)
print('The rate of interest is', r)

si = (p * t * r)/100

print('The Simple Interest is', si)


# o/p :
# Enter the value of the principal : 7
# Enter the value of the time : 8
# Enter the value of the rate of intrest  : 4
# The principal is 7
# The time period is 8
# The rate of interest is 4
# The Simple Interest is 2.24
